📱 Writer Repository

Project Overview
For people like me, coding can seem daunting, and it's easy to get caught up in what you could possibly create versus actually creating the apps. I wanted to make a simple app where people can track their favorite writers, organize them by favoriting them, adding bios, or attributing quotes to them.

The app is deployed at week9-rma57kx97-marga-sjs-projects.vercel.app, and this video shows it off https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ofw68r90w1yPrWHOfJIvkbXfB6btXEEg/view?usp=drive_link

Initial Prompt and Cursor Response

> Create a web app designed to track users' favorite writers. Allow them to input a name, favorite it, then add spaces for them to add a short author bio and attribute quotes to them.

**Cursor's Response:**

Cursor generated a basic app similar to the beginning test apps we started learning with.

**Was it what you expected?**

Yes, Cursor built a good foundation, but I had to tweak a few things to make it more customized and more to my liking.

## Followup Prompts Regarding Features, and Cursor Responses

Here are **ten feature-related prompts** I gave to Cursor and what happened:

1. **Prompt:** “Change the font to a monospace font”
    
    **Response:** Cursor made all the fonts courier new, as before the app generated 2-3 different fonts.
    
2. **Prompt:** “Allow users to add writer profiles.”
    
    **Response:** Added a box to input names and a save button.
    
3. **Prompt:** “Add the ability to favorite writers.”
    
    **Response:** Implemented a small toggle-able star icon beside the name header.
    
4. **Prompt:** “Add areas to include a writer bio.”
    
    **Response:** A 'bio' option appeared once you click on the writer name and expand the box.
    
5. **Prompt:** “Add an area that can store multiple quotes inputted by the user.”
    
    **Response:** Cursor added an area under the bio that stored multiple quotes.
    

## Followup Prompts Regarding User Interface, and Cursor Responses

Here are **five UI prompts** I gave to Cursor:

1. **Prompt:** “Update the UI to use soft pink and purple.”
    
    **Response:** Cursor updated the app from the typical monochrome/black and white background to have soft pink as its primary color and soft purple as a second color. It also made the buttons a nice gradient of pink and purple.
    
2. **Prompt:** “Update the header to have 'Writer Repository' instead.”
    
    **Response:** Updated the main header to have the customized name instead of the default generated one.

## Summary

**Final App Description:**

The final app is a simple web app where users can log and favorite writers with biographies and attributed quotes.

**What I liked about Cursor:**

- It created a functional website with intuitive features.
- The website had a very pleasant UI.
- Cursor was able to debug and scan for issues in its own code.

**Challenges / Issues:**

- Sometimes Cursor added incorrect file paths or syntax errors.
- Trying to integrate AI with API keys from Open AI was difficult.
- I wish we had learned traditional coding as well to give me a stronger basic foundation.
  
Overall, this project helped me build a full-stack app even without a CS background. Cursor was a powerful coding partner, and I now feel more confident building and deploying apps, but perhaps need to organize my files better. I also learned how to use 'inspect' on mac and turned on AI reccomendations to further see errors running on my browser.
